## Challenge 1 - Diamond Hands

*Difficulty*
* Solidity: Easy
* dApp: n/a

*Objectives*
* Build a diamond hands contract that allows users to deposit ETH. Every time they deposit ETH, it will be locked for two years.
* After two years, they will be able to withdraw the ETH.
* Your implementation should run unit tests on the contract, and actually confirm all of its functionality.

*Hints*
* Use hardhat - it has everything you need to compile, run a local chain, run unit tests, skip forward in time, etc.

## Solution

```zsh
yarn
yarn test
```
